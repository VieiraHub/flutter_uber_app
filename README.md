In this app it is possible for the user to register and choose between passenger or driver.
After completing the registration the user can access the app with user and pass.
On the main panel of the app, the passenger user can write the address he wants to go to,
and by clicking on the call button, the order will be confirmed and a request will be created for the driver.
The driver user can see the passenger requirements, and can choose which race he wants to take.
When choosing a race the driver is able to accept the race and the passengerâ€™s location is displayed.
When the driver moves, the passenger can see the driver moving on the map.
Upon reaching the passenger's destination the driver is able to finish the race,
and the total trip is displayed, so that the passenger can make the payment for the race.
